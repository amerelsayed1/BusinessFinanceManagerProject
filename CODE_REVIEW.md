# Code Review Notes

## Frontend (Vue)
1. **Monolithic application shell** – `src/App.vue` owns authentication gating, layout, manual tab routing, API calls for accounts/expenses/bills, and modal management all in one component (lines 34-405, 407-737). This makes it difficult to reason about concerns in isolation and prevents route-level code splitting or reuse; consider moving data fetching and feature logic into the corresponding page components and leaning on the router instead of a `currentTab` flag for navigation.
2. **Errors only hit the console** – API interactions such as loading accounts/expenses/bills and CRUD operations log failures to the console without surfacing user feedback or rollback paths (e.g., lines 169-203, 205-358). Users have no indication that requests failed and stale UI state may be displayed; prefer surfaced notifications, retries, and minimal optimistic updates with proper error handling.
3. **Client-only date filtering of full datasets** – The component fetches expenses and bills (initially without a month constraint) and then filters them on the client for the selected month (lines 98-166). Although `loadExpenses` can accept a month string (lines 181-194), month navigation only updates local state and never re-queries the API, which can become heavy for large histories and risks drift from the backend source of truth. Hook month changes to server-side filters and add pagination where possible.
